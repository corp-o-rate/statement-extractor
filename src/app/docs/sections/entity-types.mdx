## Entity Types

<a id="entity-types"></a>

Corp-extractor classifies extracted subjects and objects into **13 entity types** based on common Named Entity Recognition (NER) standards. Understanding these types helps you filter and process extracted statements effectively.

### Accessing Entity Types in Code

<a id="accessing-entity-types"></a>

Each extracted statement contains subject and object entities with a `type` attribute:

```python
from statement_extractor import extract_statements

result = extract_statements("Apple CEO Tim Cook announced the iPhone 15.")

for stmt in result:
    print(f"Subject: {stmt.subject.text} ({stmt.subject.type})")
    print(f"Object: {stmt.object.text} ({stmt.object.type})")
```

Output:

```
Subject: Apple (ORG)
Object: Tim Cook (PERSON)
Subject: Tim Cook (PERSON)
Object: iPhone 15 (PRODUCT)
```

You can also import the `EntityType` enum for type checking and comparisons:

```python
from statement_extractor import extract_statements, EntityType

result = extract_statements("Microsoft acquired Activision for $69 billion.")

for stmt in result:
    if stmt.subject.type == EntityType.ORG:
        print(f"Organization found: {stmt.subject.text}")
    if stmt.object.type == EntityType.MONEY:
        print(f"Monetary value: {stmt.object.text}")
```

### Filtering by Entity Type

<a id="filtering-by-entity-type"></a>

A common use case is extracting only statements involving specific entity types. Here is how to filter statements by subject or object type:

```python
from statement_extractor import extract_statements, EntityType

text = """
Apple announced revenue of $94.8 billion for Q3 2024.
CEO Tim Cook presented at the company's Cupertino headquarters.
The new iPhone 16 features improved battery life of 22 hours.
"""

result = extract_statements(text)

# Filter for statements where subject is an organization
org_statements = [
    stmt for stmt in result
    if stmt.subject.type == EntityType.ORG
]

# Filter for statements involving monetary values
money_statements = [
    stmt for stmt in result
    if stmt.subject.type == EntityType.MONEY or stmt.object.type == EntityType.MONEY
]

# Filter for statements about people
person_statements = [
    stmt for stmt in result
    if stmt.subject.type == EntityType.PERSON or stmt.object.type == EntityType.PERSON
]

print(f"Found {len(org_statements)} statements from organizations")
print(f"Found {len(money_statements)} statements with monetary values")
print(f"Found {len(person_statements)} statements about people")
```

### The UNKNOWN Type

<a id="unknown-type"></a>

The `UNKNOWN` entity type is used as a fallback when the model cannot confidently classify an entity into one of the 12 standard categories. This typically occurs with:

- **Specialized domain terms**: Technical jargon, industry-specific terminology
- **Ambiguous entities**: Terms that could fit multiple categories depending on context
- **Novel entities**: New terms or concepts not well-represented in training data
- **Abstract concepts**: Ideas or qualities that do not fit standard NER categories

```python
from statement_extractor import extract_statements, EntityType

result = extract_statements("The synergy initiative improved operational efficiency.")

for stmt in result:
    if stmt.subject.type == EntityType.UNKNOWN:
        print(f"Unclassified entity: {stmt.subject.text}")
        # Consider manual review or domain-specific handling
```

When you encounter `UNKNOWN` entities, consider:

1. **Manual review**: Inspect the entity text to determine appropriate handling
2. **Domain mapping**: Create application-specific mappings for recurring unknown entities
3. **Context analysis**: Use surrounding statements to infer the entity's likely type

### Entity Type Standards

<a id="entity-type-standards"></a>

Corp-extractor's entity types are based on widely-adopted NER standards, including:

- **OntoNotes 5.0**: The primary source for entity type definitions
- **ACE (Automatic Content Extraction)**: Influences the GPE vs LOC distinction
- **CoNLL-2003**: Foundational NER task categories

This alignment with established standards ensures compatibility with other NLP tools and facilitates integration into existing data pipelines.
